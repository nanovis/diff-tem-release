# This file defines the position and orientation of three 
# copies of the TMV fragment.
# 
# The file has 3 lines of data and each line contains 6 records:
#
  3 6
#
# The first particle is placed at position (-50,0,0) with its 
# initial orientation (axis of TMV along the z-axis):
#
-50  5  0  0   0   0
#
# The second particle is placed at position (0,0,0) after being
# rotated 90 degrees around the x-axis:
#
  0  5  0  0  90   0
#
# The third particle is placed at position (50,0,0) after being
# rotated 90 degrees around the x-axis and then 90 degrees around
# the z-axis. (The fourth column, which is 0 for all the particles,
# also specifies a rotation around the z-axis.)
